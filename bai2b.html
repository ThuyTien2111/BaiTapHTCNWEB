        Yes, I really don’t see anything wrong with it. If you’re worried about the use of the <u>determine</u> some along with a <b> <i>plural (books)</i></b> , then you’ve got nothing to worry about for the <u>combination</u> totally works. <b><i>A gross</i></b>  error would be if you <u>go ahead and turn</u> that have into its continuous having, which would lead to imply- <u>“I’m eating my books.”</u> Certainly you don’t want to do that! :) Have <u>remains</u> a stative verb here as have itself. So really there are no <b><i>qualms</i></b>  about the sentence.
